# ESP32

## install tools:
- just clone [esp-idf](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf), currently I'm using V5.2 branch.
- in root of this folder, run install.bat to install all required tools.

## Build a project:
- going to root of project
- set IDF_TOOLS_PATH = local_path\esp_idf_tools
- run export.bat
- we can use `my_export.bat` or `my_export.sh` instead, these two files are in root of this repo.
